Stock Price Forecast using RNN &amp; LSTM


Predicting stock price using historical data of a company, using Recurrent Neural networks with LSTM.

This project includes python programs to show Keras LSTM can be used to predict future stock prices for a company using it's historical stock price data. You can also find sample programs on how to fine tune Hyperprameters of LSTM (or any Neural Network for that matter).
